        "ans : **List are mutable:**\n",
        "        Lists are designed to be flexible containers that can hold items and allow modifications such as:\n",
        "        1.  Adding elements (append, extend)\n",

        "        Internally, Python implements lists as dynamic arrays, so their size and content can change without creating a new object.\n",

        "    Reasons for immutability:\n",
        "    1. Safety: Tuples are often used as keys in dictionaries. Mutable objects can’t be dictionary keys because their hash can change.\n",
        "    2. Performance: Immutable objects are faster to access because Python doesn’t need to manage dynamic resizing.\n",
        "    3. Predictability: Their contents won’t change unexpectedly, which makes code safer and easier to debug.\n",
